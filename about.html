                            <p class="mb-4"> Feni Diabetic Association (FDA) is a non-profit voluntary service-oriented
                                organization that
                                aims to support individuals living with diabetes and provide treatment in Bangladesh. It
                                has
                                emerged as a beacon of hope and support for individuals with diabetes and various health
                                disorders. FDA embarked on its journey from 1<sup>st</sup> October 1993 through the
                                collective
                                efforts of
                                compassionate local social workers and organizers. Since then, it has been actively
                                involved in
                                various initiatives to combat diabetes and positively impact the community.<br><br>
                                Late National Professor Dr. Mohammed Ibrahim was a pioneer in revolutionizing diabetic
                                care in
                                our country. Recognizing the complex nature of diabetes, he understood that effective
                                management
                                required active involvement not just from doctors, but also from the patients
                                themselves.
                                Consequently, he envisioned a socio-medical model of care that emphasized the crucial
                                role
                                patients play in managing their condition effectively.

                                Branch.<br><br>

                                under the government scheme immediately after its establishment. According to the former
                                secretary general of DAB, Fasih Uddin Mahtab, “Feni Diabetic Association is moving
                                forward at the speed of a rocket”. Due to the competent and courageous role of the
                                former Feni district administration officials and civil surgeons as well as
                                non-government social workers, this hospital prospered in a very short time. Former
                                Deputy Commissioner of Feni Iftekhar Ahmed, A.H.M Nurul Islam, Debashish Nag, Noor
                                Mohammad, A.F.M Solaiman Chowdhury, Masum Khan, and Civil Surgeons Dr. Shamsul Alam, Dr.
                                Md. Mokhlesur Rahman, Dr. Md. Rashiduzzman, Dr. Mainuddin Chowdhury and Dr. Kazi Ismail
                                Amanullah's contribution is undeniable. From the beginning, Diabetic Association of
                                Bangladesh has been giving annual donations. Besides, DAB President National Professor
                                A.K. Azad Khan played a role in financial development by conducting medical
                                camps.<br><br>

                                An attempt was made to increase the number of beds by starting the construction of the
                                4th, 5th, and 6th floors on 1 October 2006. Gradually, 125-bed hospital facility was
                                created by constructing 4, 5 and 6 floors with own financing. On September 6, 2004, the
                                Health Secretary of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh A.F.M Sarwar
                                Kamal inaugurated Blood Bank and expressed his satisfaction.<br><br>

                                Although approved number of beds in the hospital is 50. An application has been made to
                                DG Health to increase it to 100 beds. At present, an average of 80/90 patients are
                                admitted daily. Nurul-Rawnak Diabetes Health Service Sub-Centre was started in 2013 at
                                Dhalia of Feni Sadar to deal with the increasing pressure of patients. The current
                                number of registered diabetic patients is 1.5 lac. The present life member of the
                                association is 314. Since its inception 67 patrons/founders/life members have passed
                                away. Currently, 323 officers and employees are engaged in various departments,
                                including 40 doctors and 71 nursing staff.<br><br>

                                A pharmacy naming 'Feni Diabetes Hospital Medical Hall' was launched in 2011 to ensure
                                affordable and easy access to medicines for diabetic patients and in-patients of the
                                hospital. Although the service activities were started on a small scale, the pharmacy
                                currently managed by 15 employees has emerged as a large service organization.<br><br>

                                In 2013, a Hemodialysis Unit was introduced to alleviate the suffering of dialysis
                                patients in these areas. About 60 lacs Tk. spent to launch this department with complete
                                self-financing. An average of 10 patients are being given dialysis services per day in 5
                                machines. The recent donation of a machine from Mercantile Bank Ltd. is making it’s
                                possible to provide continuous dialysis services.<br><br>

                                In 2017, Honorable Member of The Parliament from Feni-2 Nizam Uddin Hazari donated 20
                                lacs Tk. to start a CCU in the name of his parents due to an alarming rise in heart
                                disease. A 6-bedded CCU was started there, after naming the ward 'Commissioner Zainal
                                Abdin and Del Afroz Begum'.<br><br>

                                When the healthcare system of the whole country was about to collapse during the
                                covid-19 pandemic, Shusen Chandra Shil, general secretary of the association led from
                                the front and set up a separate covid ward with donations from the Haji Nazir Ahmad
                                group. He contacted Alauddin Ahmed Chowdhury Nasim, Chairman of ‘Salahuddin Hosneyara
                                Foundation’, and arranged to start 3 bed ICU in the name of ‘Salahuddin Hosneyara
                                Foundation’. It saved the lives of many critical patients.<br><br>

                                Due to the pressure of the patients of Greater Noakhali, Chouddagram of Comilla,
                                Mirsarai of Chittagong, and hilly districts, Feni Diabetes Hospital has suffered from
                                the lack of infrastructure, the executive council of the Feni Diabetic Association has
                                already taken up the project of constructing two 15-storied buildings on the east and
                                western sides of the main building. In between the east building has already been
                                completed with 13-storey roof casting through the project committee. If the west
                                building project will be built with the help of the government project donation the
                                number of beds in the hospital will be increased to 250 and it will be possible to take
                                another step forward in realizing the dream of making a medical college. Diabetic
                                Association of Bangladesh, Feni District Administration, and the Health Department have
                                been cooperating in this work as before.<br><br>

                                Feni Diabetic Association is indeed progressing at rocket speed, as the association has
                                been running under dedicated leadership since its inception. Present A.K.M. Shaheed Reza
                                Shimul and Shusen Chandra Shil’s led council are moving ahead with the desired goal of
                                building an excellent medical college with integrity, transparency, and dynamism. We
                                feel proud to be a servant/member of this organization.
